For Loop
    for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure unlike a while loop a for statement consues the initialization condtion and increment / decrement in  one line there by providing a shorter easy to debug structure of looping

    syntax:

    for(initialization condtion; testing condtion; increment/decrement){
        statement(s)
    }
