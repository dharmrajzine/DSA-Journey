looping in programming languages is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. Java provides three ways for excuting the loops. while all the ways provide similar basic functionality they differ in their syntas and condition checking time.

1. WHILE LOOP 
2. FOR LOOP 
3. DO WHILE
