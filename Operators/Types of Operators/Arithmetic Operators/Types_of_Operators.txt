    Binary
    +   Addition
    -   Subtraction
    *   Multiplication
    /   Division
    %   (Modulus Operator) return remainder

- Relational Operators 
    Java Relational Operators are a bunch of binary operators used to check for relations between two operands including equality, greater than, less than etc.

    - Equal to (==)
    - Not equal to (!=)
    - Greater than (>)
    - Less than (<)
    - Greater than or equal to (>=)
    - Less than or equal to (<=)

- Assignment Operators
    the Assignment Operator is generally of two types.

1- Simple Assignment Operator
    the simple Assignment Operator is used with "=" sign.

    - = is used to assign the value on the right to the variable on the left.

2- Compound Assignment Operator
    The Compound Operator is used where +,-,* and / is used with the = Operator.

    - += it operates by adding the current value off the variable on the left to the value on the right and then assigning the result to the ioerand on the left.

    - -= It operates by subtracting the variableâ€™s value on the right from the current value of the variable on the left and then assigning the result to the operand on the left. 

    - *= It operates by multiplying the current value of the variable on the left to the value on the right and then assigning the result to the operand on the left. 

    - /= It operates by dividing the current value of the variable on the left by the value on the right and then assigning the quotient to the operand on the left. 

    - %= It operates by dividing the current value of the variable on the left by the value on the right and then assigning the remainder to the operand on the left.
