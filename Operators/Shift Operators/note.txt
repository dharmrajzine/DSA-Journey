in java shift operators are the special type of operators that work on the bits of the data.
These operators are used to shift the bits of the numbers from left to right or right to left depending on the type of shift operator used.

1. Signed Left Shift Operator <<
    the left shift operator moves all bits by a given number of bits to the left.

2. Signed Right Shift >>
    the right shift operator moves all bits by a given number of bits to the right.

3. Unsigned Right Shift >>>
    it is the same as the signed right shift, but the vacant leftmost position is filled with 0 instead of the sign bit.
